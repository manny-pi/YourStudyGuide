## Project Description

### Summary

**EverLearn** is leverages the functionalities of a *calender*, *reminders*, *notes*, *project management*, and *learnimg management system* to creative your personal adaptive learning companion.

### Details

**EverLearn** is a real-time, adaptive learning agent that is designed to streamline the learning process for students and technical hobbyists.

## Motivation

Problem with learning on your own is that you hit a lot of roadblocks, dead-ends, e.t.c. When you’re in school, the purpose of a teacher is to address those roadblocks and dead-ends, so you don’t have to expend the unnecessary effort to do so, and waste time in the process. If you’re able to go to school, great. Get that knowledge. But most people on earth can’t afford a formal education, so they rely on open-source tools, books, and libraries to satisfy their interests.

What I’m proposing is a platform that acts as a virtual teacher to help guide you through the knowledge and skill acquisition process, so that you spend the least time exploring useless branches of a discovery, and align your mental of the subject under study with greater accuracy.

## Project Details

### Core Functionality

The following are the core functions of the **EverLearn** platform:

    1. **Adaptive Learning**: Reinforcement learning allows the app to dynamically adjust its teaching strategies based on the learner's performance, ensuring optimal learning efficiency.
    2. **Personalized Understanding**: Neural-language models provide insights into the learner's associative patterns, enabling the app to tailor content and explanations to their unique cognitive style.
    3. **Real-time Feedback**: By monitoring the learner's interactions and comparing them to the "true" embedding of knowledge, the app can offer immediate feedback and guidance.
    4. **Metacognition**: Incorporating metacognitive features that help learners reflect on their learning processes and develop self-regulation strategies.
    5. **Gamification**: Employing game-based elements to make learning more enjoyable and motivating
    6. **Efficable Learning Paths**: By exploring different sequences of steps that maximize the efficiency with which skills are gained, learners reduce time wasted on exploring deadends in their learning.

### UI Consideration

The UI for **EverLearn** is going to be a very important aspect of this platform, as this is how the user will interact with the interact.

The following features must be included on the platform:

**Interactive Semantic Graph**: An interactive tree that allows the user to explore the network of concepts visually.
**Content Exploration Trees**: This is related to the semantic graph; The agent will use this component to propose suggested learning paths.
